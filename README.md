V 0.1 of this shitty game jam is finally in!

The base of the game idea is here: A twinstick where you separate enemies and objects with one hand and merge them together with the other.

Right now, you can only separate skeletons and you can only merge their one piece of loot with yourself.

You can "carry" up to 4 bones right now. In the future, there'll be benefits and drawbacks to items as well as combos between items.
Conceptually.

Or I'll never touch it again. 6 of one, half dozen of the other.
